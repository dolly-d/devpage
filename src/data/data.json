        "paragraph": "Hello! My name is Dolly and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who enjoys building beautiful applications and troubleshooting through problems. I am a Brooklyn native who loves traveling, beauty, fashion, gaming, health, fitness & so much more! Before transitioning into Software Engineering, I was an Assistant Merchandiser at Bergdorf Goodman and after 10 years, I was ready to challenge myself and move into a career that will always keep me learning. I got into Software Engineering because I noticed retail was changing & I had to figure out how to change with it. I never thought that I was smart enough to do anything in the technical field much less software engineering but I was ready to make a change. I decided to take a leave from my job and fully commit to learning how to program. After spending 2 months working through freecode.org, I enrolled in the Flatiron School where I experienced a huge learning curve.  It was extremely scary at first but 6 months later I built a mobile application all on my own & it was such a rewarding feeling for me. Now I'm ready to bring everything I've learned into the real world with dash of my sassy but very fun personality!",
